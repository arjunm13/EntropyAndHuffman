This Xcode project impliments the calculation of the entropy of an image using 
OpenCV implimented in C++ 

More information on Entropy:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29

Screenshot below shows normalized value for the number of occurances for each of the 256 symbols from 127 to -128: 

The Entropy is then used to construct a variable-length code table, which allows for 8 bit characters to be replaced with less characters
